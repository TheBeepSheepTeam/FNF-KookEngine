# Building Kook Engine
Please stop using Haxe 4.1.5 and use [the latest Haxe.](https://haxe.org/download/)  Because, 4.1.5 forgets a lot of stuff.
Then execute this command.
```
haxelib install lime
haxelib install openfl
haxelib install flixel
haxelib run lime setup flixel
haxelib run lime setup
haxelib install flixel-tools
haxelib run flixel-tools setup
haxelib install flixel-addons
haxelib install flixel-ui
haxelib install hscript
haxelib install newgrounds 1.1.5
haxelib install hxCodec
haxelib install hxcpp-debug-server
```
Next, [install Git.](https://git-scm.com/downloads)  
Then, execute this command.
```
haxelib git polymod https://github.com/larsiusprime/polymod.git
haxelib git discord_rpc https://github.com/Aidan63/linc_discord-rpc
```
At the moment, you can optionally fix the transition bug in songs with zoomed-out cameras.
```
haxelib git flixel-addons https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/flixel-addons
```
Run build-Itch-WINDOWS.bat in /art/ and build.
